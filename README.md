# Starter template - [Blog]

This is a research project where we try to achieve order by following good practices. The starter template has basic functionalities, which will be detailed in the documentation of the corresponding endpoints.

## An approach to the main features:

- Once you register, you will receive an email to confirm your account. If the account is not confirmed, you will not be able to log in.

- For the creation of Posts, Comments and Categories and comments, cookies are used to know if you are logged in, and the validity of the Bearer token is verified.

- The user is created as "USER" by default. And only administrators "ADMIN" are the ones who can have actions to delete comments, categories or users.

## Stack: 

- Node
- Express
- Typescript
- MongoDB (Mongoose)

## External integrations:

- Nodemailer
- Cloduinary

## Endpoints documentation:

For practicality, the documentation of the Endpoints is in Postman. You can see everything you need in detail at [this link]().
